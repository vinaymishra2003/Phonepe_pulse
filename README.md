Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering and data analysis workflow, starting from data acquisition to interactive visualization. The objective of the project is to extract raw data from a GitHub repository, process and store it in a MySQL database using Python, perform SQL-based analysis, and present insights through an interactive Streamlit application.

Workflow Summary
1. Repository Cloning and Data Extraction

The project begins by cloning a GitHub data repository. Raw data is extracted from multiple folders within the repository and loaded into Python. The extracted data is stored in structured variables to enable efficient processing and transformation.

2. Database Creation and Data Storage

A connection is established between Python and MySQL. Using Python, a new MySQL database is created programmatically. Database tables are designed and created based on the structure of the extracted data. The processed data is then inserted into the respective tables within the database.

3. Data Cleaning and Problem Resolution Using SQL

SQL queries are used to identify and resolve data-related issues. This includes handling inconsistencies, validating records, and performing necessary transformations. These steps ensure that the data is clean, accurate, and ready for analysis.

4. Data Analysis and Visualization

Analytical SQL queries are executed on the MySQL database to generate insights. The query results are further processed using Python. Various graphs and charts are created to visually represent trends, patterns, and key findings in the data.

5. Streamlit Application Development

An interactive Streamlit web application is developed to present the analysis. The application integrates MySQL queries and Python-based data processing. All insights and analyses are demonstrated through graphical visualizations, providing a user-friendly interface for data exploration.
